        "description": "Basking Ridge was home to the Old Oak Tree, a 600-year-old white oak, perhaps the oldest white oak in the world. The tree was located on the historic graveyard of the local Presbyterian church. The tree was 97 feet (30\u00a0m) high and had a trunk circumference of 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) and its lower branches were supported. In 2016 the tree showed signs of distress as its upper parts failed to sprout leaves. A big portion of the tree was cut down in 2017 due to decay. The tree has since been cut down as of April 26, 2017."

The hospital was built with three wards, that held patients in its hub and each of the three wards held eight patients. Patient beds were oriented so that their heads were closest to the walls of the buildings. When temperatures fell, a \"fire was built in the midst of the ward, without any chimney, and the smoke circulating about, passed off through an opening about 4 inches wide in the ridge of the roof.\" Tilton described how the design of the building allowed infection to be fought using smoke, \"without giving the least offense to the patient, for it always rose above their heads, before it spread abroad in the ward.\" This hospital, which could accommodate up to 55 patients, provided an uncrowded but fully ventilated space in which those with infectious disease could be kept apart from those who were wounded."
